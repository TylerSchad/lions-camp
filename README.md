# lions-camp
An HTML and CSS project for Advanced Web Design, where we had to make a website for an existing or made-up company.
I chose to make my webpage for Colorado Lions Camp, a nonprofit that gives people with disabilities a summer camp experience.
I worked at Lions Camp for 2 consecutive summers, and wanted to provide an alternative in case they wanted a new website.
